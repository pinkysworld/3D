# Sternenschweif Web Tribute

This project delivers a playable browser experience inspired by **Das Schwarze Auge – Sternenschweif**. It features a handcrafted 3D world rendered with Three.js, complete with a fortified town, surrounding forest, interactive collectibles, and an NPC quest giver. Players can move freely through the scene, gather items for their inventory, and complete a short quest line.

## Features

- First-person exploration with mouse look, sprinting, and jumping.
- Stylized terrain, town walls, houses, forge, pond, and a dense conifer forest.
- Interactive collectibles with floating animation effects.
- Inventory management UI and quest log overlay styled to evoke classic Aventurian aesthetics.
- Quest progression culminating in reporting back to Captain Aranth.
